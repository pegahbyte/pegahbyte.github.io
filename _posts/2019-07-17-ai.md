## Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence
### Classification of Pigmented Skin Lesions

In this project, I classified images of common pigmented skin lesions in either
**benign** or **cancerous**. I built different deep neural network architectures both with and without transfer learned weights.

For this purpose, I used the ["HAM10000" dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DBW86T), a large collection of multi-source dermatoscopic images of common pigmented skin lesions which can serve as a training set for academic machine learning purposes.
