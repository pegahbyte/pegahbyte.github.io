## Natural Language Processing
### Sentence Matching
In this project, I coded a program that understands if an "answer" corresponds to a "concern". The data set is a tiny dummy data set for testing purposes. The code can be run on larger data sets.

I have used FastText pre-trained word-embeddings after I have pre-processed the text data with the nltk library.

You have to download the ['wiki-news-300d-1M.vec'](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/english-vectors.html) if you like to run the full code.
