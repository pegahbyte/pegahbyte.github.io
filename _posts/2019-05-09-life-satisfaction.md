### What factors influence life satisfaction?

To answer this question, I looked at data from the World Value Survey. The goal of this analysis is to find and select the most important factors that are correlated to self-reported life-satisfaction. 
To do so, I conducted a regression analysis and a lasso regression analysis. Moreover, I clustered the data and re-analysed it on cluster level with interesting findings.
