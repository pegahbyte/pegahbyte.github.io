### Data Visualization on Green Parties in Europe

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/greens.png" alt="linearly separable data">

The goal of this exploratory data analysis is to understand how green parties have developed in Europe and how their main political domain of environmental awareness emerged in other parties' political program. Part A investigates the success of different Green Parties across Europe and across time and if, when and where environmental issues have found their way into other parties' program. 
In Part B, the Green parties themselves are characterized in relation to other parties and in their alteration over time.
